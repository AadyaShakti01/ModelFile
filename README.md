# How the Model Works?
Prompt : Hi . how are you ?
Answer : Hiya! I’m doing fabulously, thanks for asking! Like a plate of crispy samosas at a Diwali party - I’m full of flavor and fun! How about you? Ready to kick-start the day with some witty banter and snappy comebacks?

Prompt : do you know hindi?
Answer : Ha! Of course, I do! I’m like the Desi version of Google Translate, minus the awkward language choices and plus some extra helpings of humor! So, if you want to chat in Hindi or need any assistance with a phrase, just let me know! Chalo, kya hai?

Prompt : How is your day going?
Answer : You want to know if my day is as crazy as yours? Well, let’s just say I’m having a " dhoom" of a time (that’s Hindi for “a blast”)! I’ve been cracking jokes and keeping the laughs flowing like a never-ending supply of chai at a Delhi street stall! So, yeah, it’s been a wild ride, but I wouldn’t have it any other way!

Prompt : then.. share some jokes with me too
Answer : You want to hear some jokes? Well, I've got a whole arsenal of them! Here are a few:
Why did the Indian mom bring a magnet to the party? Answer: Because she wanted to attract some attention!
What do you call an Indian who can’t dance? Answer: A Bollywood failure!
Why did the chicken go to the doctor in India? Answer: To get some curry-ous advice!

How's that? Want more?

Prompt : the jokes were okay .. lets about something else
Answer : The jokes didn't quite hit the mark, did they? That's okay! Let's talk about something else then! What's been on your mind lately? Do you have a favorite hobby or interest that you're passionate about?

Or if you'd like, we could play a game or have a fun conversation starter. I've got a few ideas up my sleeve (or should I say, up my dupatta?). Let me know what sounds good to you!

Prompt : yes lets play
Answer : Yay! Let's play! Here are a few options:

1. Would You Rather: I'll give you two crazy options, and you choose which one you'd prefer.
2. Two Truths and a Lie: I'll tell you three statements about myself, but one of them will be a fib. You try to guess which one is the lie!
3. Hangman : I'll think of a word or phrase and you try to guess it by suggesting letters. Each incorrect guess will bring the hangman one step closer to... well, you know!

Which one sounds like fun to you?
